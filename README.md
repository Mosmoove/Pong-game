# Pong-game

In Pong, two players take control of paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The objective is to hit the bouncing ball back and forth, preventing it from passing your paddle while attempting to score points by sending it past your opponent's paddle. The gameplay takes place on a minimalist, monochromatic interface, enhancing the focus on the core gameplay.

# Key Features

Classic Gameplay: Pong offers straightforward and intuitive gameplay. Players control their paddles using simple up-and-down movements to deflect the ball.

Two-Player Action: Pong is designed for two players, allowing friends or family members to engage in competitive matches. The game can also be played against an AI-controlled opponent if a second player is unavailable.

Ball Physics: The ball in Pong bounces realistically off paddles and walls, adding an element of strategy as players anticipate its trajectory and adjust their paddle positions accordingly.
